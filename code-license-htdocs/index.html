    </p>

    <p>
        I mean, they're important, but boring. If you're anything like me, a license is an
        afterthought. I'll either create a new project folder and start coding, or set up a
        new GitHub repo, clone it, and type away. Fast-forward to the inevitable pull-request
        from someone asking to have a license added so the project can be considered as
        a dependency for another project.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses">
            Each license has its trade-offs.
        </a>
        Depending on the product, package, library or snippet you're creating, a
        license you select for one project may not work for another. So you can
        hunt down the license text, and put your info in every time you change it.
        <yodawg>Or you can include a simple link in your <code>LICENSE</code> file 
        and at the top of each code page.</yodawg>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        <a href="https://example.code-license.org"><yodawg>https://example.code-license.org</yodawg></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Now all you have to do is remember your username, and you can add a URL license at
        the head of each file. Or just reference it in your <code>README</code>. It'll default
        to the generous <a href="https://angrychimp.code-license.org/">MIT License</a>, but
        you can set your own default, or tweak it on a per-project basis. Our goal is to
        make it easier to properly license all source projects so that the collabortive
        web can become a safer place for code re-use.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you're ready to get started, head over the project README to learn more about
        how this all works, and how to request your own custom license domain.
